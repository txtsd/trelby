# We had a bug where pasting on an empty line right after a forced linebreak
# would think "oh, I'm in an empty element, I'll just change the linetype of
# this line and be done with it", which is wrong, because the linetypes of the
# lines above were not changed, and now you had an element with multiple
# different linetypes. The right thing to do is not change the linetypes at all
# unless the entire element is empty.
